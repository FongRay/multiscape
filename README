**About**
MultiScape is a Mac application that scales, crops, saves and applies a single image to multiple desktops—a simple thing that can take lots of time by hand. What’s best about MultiScape is that it’s really simple. All you have to do is supply it with an image. It retrieves the desktop layout information from the Mac OS and goes from there. The process takes seconds.

**How to use**
Simply drag and drop any image onto the window. It can be a image on the local computer or something from a browser or anywhere else!

**Thanks**
David Zwerdling for the original code

**New**
I fork this repo to simple the scale method with branch `simple_scale`, I will detect your displays and suggest find a image with MAX(widths) * MAX(heights) resolution, then just cut the image to fit all the displays without scaling.
